## About The Project

Rewards Calculator:

An application used by retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. Built with React, Redux, JavaScript, and CSS.

Note: Implemented changes in a way to get data from API using fetch calls.
      If backend isn't available will use the mock data in the UI.

      Implemented backend using spring rest controllers. 
      Instead of storing data into the database or filesystem, made use of in-memory.
